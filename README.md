# Destiny.gg Chat Bot

## Runnin' it

There will eventually be a time when you'll need a configuration file but it's not built out yet. 
The simple one under configuration is fine.

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Contribution

The bot is currently in a state of flux, APIs will break until a more solid foundation is arrived at. 
Feel free to poke around, but contributions are going to be tough until the base systems are in place.
The most help right now would actually be documenting and reverse engineering and old bot behavior that 
isn't currently documented in the existing repos.


## Todo

- User Permissions and Validation of command structure
- Integration with various APIs (instagram, youtube, twitch etc.)
- Clearly defined spam rules
- Scheduling static commands to run on intervals
- Punishment features
- Integration tests, more unit tests, always more tests
- Probably lots more
